  "description": "Each object in this OCFL repository is identified by a UUID in the format 'ora.ox.ac.uk:uuid:{uuid}'.\nAn object's identifier is also the name of the directory containing that object. Directories containing objects are placed at the end of a pair-tree structure. The pair-tree structure is four directories deep, with each directory named for the corresponding two bytes of the first eight bytes of the UUID. For example, object ora.ox.ac.uk:uuid:12345678-1234-1234-1234-12345678abcd can be found at /12/34/56/78/ora.ox.ac.uk:uuid:12345678-1234-1234-1234-12345678abcd",
